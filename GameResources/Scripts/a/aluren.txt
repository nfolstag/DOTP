# TODO: it should be possible to cast cards through Aluren from other zones (e.g. Graveyard), but only if there is another card allowing to cast cards from that zone.
# This is currently difficult to achieve, and adding other zones to AffectedZone makes it always possible for all players to cast cards from all the listed zones.
# Once the problem is resolved, change AffectedZone to Library,Hand,Graveyard,Exile.
